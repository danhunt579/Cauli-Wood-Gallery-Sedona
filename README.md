This is a great webpage to demonstrate truly mobile responsive design.  The mobile page becomes much more graphic once the viewport is collapsed below 480px.  The nav links in the header are displayed as text on the tablet and desktop screens but, become attractive graphics when viewed on mobile.  The text links would have looked cumbersome on mobile but, become the centerpiece of the mobile design.  The contact links become styled with white text on a red background in mobile to match the new more visual style.

There are some elements ommited in mobile to reduce clutter like the images in the article and the spotlight sub-section while elements like the contact links are removed in desktop to give the page a more polished visual appeal.

The bottom and top link elements are treated as flex to give them a nice readable spread-out look while the article and aside elements are set at different shrink and grow rates so, that the image looks balanced in all views.
